### TRANSFORMING DATA INTO INSIGHTS 

- PEOPLE ANALYTICS (human resources analytics/ workforce analytics)
		- is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company's workfforce in order to gain isights to improve how the company operates.
		- it involves using data analysis to gain insights about employees and how they experience their work lives.

###### SIX STEPS OF THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
- ASK -  define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result.
		- **asked** effective questions

- PREPARE - identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step.

- PROCESS - how their data would be **collected, stored, managed, and protected**

- ANALYZE 

-  SHARE - Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful **sharing the report**

- ACT - how best to **implement changes and take actions** based on the findings.






### UNDERSTANDING THE DATA ECOSYSTEM

**DATA ECOSYSTEM** - are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.
**CLOUD** -   is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive. So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network, that data is accessed over the internet.
		- Virtual location.

**GUT INSTINCT** - is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious..

At the heart of data-driven decision making is data.

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis. That is why analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”

In addition, try asking yourself these questions about a project to help find the perfect balance:

-   What kind of results are needed?
    
-   Who will be informed?
    
-   Am I answering the question being asked?
    
-   How quickly does a decision need to be made?


###### ORIGINS OF THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS


- Data analysis is rooted in statistics
- The ancient Egyptians were masters of organizing data. They documented their calculations and theories on papyri (paper-like materials), which are now viewed as the earliest examples of spreadsheets and checklists.
- **DATA ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE** - the process of going from data to decision.
1.  **Ask**: Business Challenge/Objective/Question
    
2.  **Prepare**: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
    
3.  **Process**: Data cleaning/data integrity
    
4.  **Analyze**: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
    
5.  **Share**: Communicating and interpreting results 
    
6.  **Act**:  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem

###### EMC's DATA ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE (David Dietrich)

1.  Discovery
    
2.  Pre-processing data
    
3.  Model planning
    
4.  Model building
    
5.  Communicate results
    
6.  Operationalize

	- Key questions help analysts test whether they have accomplished enough to move forward and ensure that teams have spent enough time on each of the phases and don’t start modeling before the data is ready.


###### SAS's ITERATIVE LIFE CYCLE 

1.  Ask
    
2.  Prepare
    
3.  Explore
    
4.  Model
    
5.  Implement
    
6.  Act
    
7.  Evaluate

- The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol.
- it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again.

###### PROJECT BASED DATA ANALYSI LIFE CYCLE  (Vignesh Prajapati)

1.  Identifying the problem
    
2.  Designing data requirements
    
3.  Pre-processing data
    
4.  Performing data analysis
    
5.  Visualizing data

	 - Doesn't have an act phase.


The data analysis process is like real life architecture, there are different ways to do things but the same core ideas still appear in each model of the process.
