#### FOLLOW THE DATA LIFE CYCLE

###### LIFE CYCLE OF DATA

- **Plan** - happens well before starting an analysis project.
	- business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.

- **Capture** - This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization.
		- One common method is getting data from outside resources.
		- Another way to get data is from a company's own documents and files
		-  **DATABASE** - Collection of data stored in a computer system.

- **Manage** - Here we're talking about how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly; important to data cleansing.

- **Analyze** - the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals.

- **Archive** - **Archiving** means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again.

- **Destroy** - This is important for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers.

To sum it up, although data life cycles vary, one data management principle is universal. Govern how data is handled so that it is accurate, secure, and available to meet your organization's needs.


#### OUTLINING THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS 


###### 6 PHASES OF DATA ANALYSIS 

**ASK** - We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
	-  
	  **STAKEHOLDERS** - people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.

- In identifying the problem you look at the current state and identify how it is different from the ideal state.
- determine who your stakeholders are. 


##### THE DATA ANALYSIS TOOLBOX

- **QUERY LANGUAGE** is a computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database.
	- Query languages
		-   Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
		-   Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
		-   Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis
	 - **SQL** is a language that lets data analysts communicate with a database.
	 - **DATABASE**  is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
	
- **Spreadsheets**  (Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. )
	- digital worksheet  stores, organizes, and sorts data.
	- Spreadsheets also have some really useful features called formulas and functions.
	- Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you:
		-   Collect, store, organize, and sort information
		-   Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
		-   Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.
	- **FORMULA** is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet.
	- **FUNCTION** is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet.
- **Visualization tools** (Tableau and Looker)
	- **VISUALIZATION** is the graphical representation of information.
	- Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.
	-These tools
		-   Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand
		-   Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies
		-   Have multiple features

- **Tableau**'s simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards andworksheets
- **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual tool you choose.
