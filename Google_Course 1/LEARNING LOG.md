-----------------------------

Throughout this course, you’ll be asked to make entries in a learning log. Your log will be a personal space where you can keep track of your thinking and reflections about the experiences you will have collecting and analyzing data. Reflections may include what you liked, what you would change, and questions that were raised. By the time you complete the entry for this activity, you will have a stronger understanding of data analytics.

Before you write an entry in your learning log, think about where and how you use data to make decisions. You will create a list of at least **five questions** that you might use data to answer. Here are a few examples to inspire you:

-   What’s the best time to go to the gym?
    
-   How does the length of your commute to work vary by day of the week?
    
-   How many cups of coffee do you drink each day?
    
-   What flavor of ice cream do customers buy?
    
-   How many hours of sleep do you get each day? 
    

Then, you will select **one** of the five questions from _your_ list to explore further and write down the types of data you might collect in order to make a decision. That’s data analysis in action!
