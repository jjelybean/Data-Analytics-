###### DATA ANALYST JOB OPPURTUNITIES

- In analytics I feel like the key to success is being able to blend the personal side with the technical side.
- understanding data, respecting data and knowing how to work with data is incredibly important because, my vision is that every role in some form or fashion will involve data and its use in learning how to extract insights from it will be at the core of any critical role across any company organization.

##### THE IMPORTANCE OF FAIR BUSINESS DECISIONS 

**ISSUE** - A topic or subject to investigat.
**QUESTION** - Designed to discover information.
**PROBLEM** - An obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out. 
**BUSINESS TASK** - The question or problem data analysis answers for a business. 

*I think one of the most important things to remember about data analytics is that data is data.*

*When we think about data ethics we're thinking about, who's collecting the data? Why are they collecting it? How are they collecting it and for what purpose?

*I think aspiring data analysts need to keep in mind that a lot of the data that you're going to encounter is data that comes from people so at the end of the day, data are people. You want to have a responsibility to those people that are represented in those data.*

*But we need to ensure that there's actionable ways in which people can consent to giving those data, and ways that they can ask for it to be revoked or removed. Data's growing and at the same time, we need to empower people to have control over their own data.*

**FAIRNESS** - Ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias.
	- Requires processes and systems that are fair and inclusive.
