### **SELECT** 
	to specify what data
### **FROM** 
	pull data from any table

*sample*

#### ***Create table and Drop table if exists***

**To select unique pieces of data from the table (use distinct)**

	SYNTAX: DISTINCT col

---------------------------------

CAST() - can convert anything from one data type to another

	SYNTAX: CAST(fielf you  to change AS data_type)

>> to sort the order use 
>> 	**ORDER BY 
>> 		*name of col*   DESC(descending)

**TYPECASTING** 
	- Converting data from one type to another.

**CONCAT()** - Adds strings together to create new text strings that can be used as unique keys

		SYNTAX: CONCAT(col1, col2) AS newCol

**COALESCE()** - Can be used to return non-null values in a list.

		SYNTAX: COALESCE(*column to check first*, column to check second when the first isnt available) AS newCol

## SUMMARY

So far, you have been introduced to many different tools available in SQL. As a brief review, you learned how to complete tasks such as:

-   Getting data from a table using **SELECT** statements.
    
-   De-duplicating data using commands like **DISTINCT** and **COUNT +** **WHERE**.
    
-   Manipulating string data with **TRIM()** and **SUBSTR**.
    
-   Creating/dropping tables with **CREATE TABLE** and **DROP TABLE**.
    
-   Changing data types with **CAST**.
    

Some of these tasks are more challenging than others, and learning all the various SQL functions takes work. But, when you practice different functions, you can master the skills needed to make SQL work the way you need it to. Take a moment to think about the parts of SQL that youâ€™ve found most challenging.
