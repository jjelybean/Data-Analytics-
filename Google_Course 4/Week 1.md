A strong analysis depends on the integrity of data.

DATA INTEGRITY - The accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its life cycle.

DATA REPLICATION - The process of storing data in multiple locations.

DATA TRANSFER -The process of copying sata from a storgae device to memory, or from one computer to another.

DATA MANIPULATION - The process of changing data to make it more organized and easier to read.

	- It is important to check that the data you use aligns with the business objective.
	- Good alignment means that the data is relevant and can help you solve a business problem or determine a course of action to achieve a given business objective.

TYPES OF INSUFFICIENT DATA

- Data from only one source
- Data that keeps updating
- Outdated data
- Geographically limited data

WAYS TO ADDRESS INSUFFICIENT DATA

- Identify trends with available data
- Wait for more data if time allows 
- Talk with stakeholders and adjust your objective
- Look for a new dataset

		- When you are getting ready for data analysis, you might realize you don’t have the data you need or you don’t have enough of it. In some cases, you can use what is known as proxy data in place of the real data. Think of it like substituting oil for butter in a recipe when you don’t have butter. In other cases, there is no reasonable substitute and your only option is to collect more data.

## Data issue 1: no data

	Gather the data on a small scale to perform a preliminary analysis and then request additional time to complete the analysis after you have collected more data

	If there isn’t time to collect data, perform the analysis using proxy data from other datasets. This is the most common workaround.


## Data issue 2: too little data	

	Do the analysis using proxy data along with actual data.

	Adjust your analysis to align with the data you already have. (include the limitations in your report )


## Data issue 3: wrong data, including data with errors


	If you have the wrong data because requirements were misunderstood, communicate the requirements again.

	Identify errors in the data and, if possible, correct them at the source by looking for a pattern in the errors.

	If you can’t correct data errors yourself, you can ignore the wrong data and go ahead with the analysis if your sample size is still large enough and ignoring the data won’t cause systematic bias.

**_sometimes data with errors can be a warning sign that the data isn’t reliable. Use your best judgment._**

SAMPLE SIZE - A part of a population that is representative of the population.

## CALCULATING THE SAMPLE SIZE


POPULATION - Entire group you are interested in your study

SAMPLE - subset of the population

MARGIN OF ERROR - Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population.

CONFIDENCE LEVEL - How confident you are in survey results 

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL - The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study.

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE - The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.


-   Don’t use a sample size less than 30. It has been statistically proven that 30 is the smallest sample size where an average result of a sample starts to represent the average result of a population.
    
-   The confidence level most commonly used is 95%, but 90% can work in some cases.


**regression analysis** – statistical methods to determine the relationships between controlled and dependent variables.


-------------------------------

STATISTICAL POWER - The probability of getting meaningful results from a test.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING - A way to see if a survey or experiment has meaningful results 

	if a test is statistically significant,it means the results of the test are real and not an error caused by random chance.
	Usually, you need a statistical power of at least 0.8 or 80% to consider your results statistically significant


CONFIDENCE LEVEL - The probability that your sample size accurately reflects the greater population.

-   **Estimated response rate**: If you are running a survey of individuals, this is the percentage of people you expect will complete your survey out of those who received the survey.

		- confidence level and margin of error dont have to add up to 100%

-----------------------------

		Margin of error is the maximum that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population.

	The closer to zero the margin of error, the closer your results from your sample would match results from the overall population.

For example, let's say you completed a nationwide survey using a sample of the population. You asked people who work five-day workweeks whether they like the idea of a four-day workweek. So your survey tells you that 60% prefer a four-day workweek. The margin of error was 10%, which tells us that between 50 and 70% like the idea. So if we were to survey all five-day workers nationwide, between 50 and 70% would agree with our results.

TO CALCULATE THE MARGIN OF ERROR YOU NEED:

- Population size 
- Sample size
- Confidence level
