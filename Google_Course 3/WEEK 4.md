DATA SECURITY - Protecting data from unauthorized access or corruption by adopting safety measures. 

**Encryption** uses a unique algorithm to alter data and make it unusable by users and applications that don’t know the algorithm. This algorithm is saved as a “key” which can be used to reverse the encryption.

**Tokenization** replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a “token."
