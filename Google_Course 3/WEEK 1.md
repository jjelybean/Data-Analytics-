Undersanding the different type of data and data structures; what type of data to use




#### COLLECTING DATA

ANNUAL BUSSINESS SURVEYS
survey data

HOW DATA IS COLLECTED
	- Interview
	- Observations
	- forms
	- questionnaires
	- surveys
	- cookies - small files stored on computers containing information about the users
			- The most effective method of data collection to ttrack people's online activities and interests.

#### DETERMINING WHAT DATA TO COLLECT


	DATA COLLECTION CONSIDERATIONS 
		- How the data will be collected
		- choose data sources 
		- decide what data to use
		- how much data to collect
		- select the right data type
		- determine the time frame

FIRST-PARTY DATA- Data collected by an individual or group using their own resources. 

SECOND-PARTY DATA - Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold.

THIRD-PARTY DATA- Data collected rom outside sources who did not collect it directly.

POPULATION - all possible data values in a certain dataset.

SAMPLE - A part of a population that is representative of the population.


SERIES DATA- data that includes dates 

#### DISCOVER DATA FORMATS


qualitative and quantitative data;

DISCRETE DATA- Data that is counted and has a limited number of values.
	Examples of other discrete data are stars and points. When partial measurements (half-stars or quarter-points) aren't allowed, the data is discrete. If you don't accept anything other than full stars or points, the data is considered discrete.

CONTINUOUS DATA - Data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value

NOMINAL DATA- A type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order.
	- doesnt have a sequence

ORDINAL DATA - A type of qualitative dat with a ser order or scale.
	- exmples (ratings from 1 to 10).

INTERNAL DATA- Data that lives within a company'sown systems.

EXTERNAL DATA- Data that lives and is generetaed ourside of an organization.

STRUCTURED DATA- Data organized in a certain format such as rows and columns.
	- works nicely with a data model
	- Structured data that is grouped together to form relations enables analysts to more easily store, search, and analyze the data.

UNSTRUCTURED DATA - Data that is not organized in any easily identifiable manner.
	- audio and video files, social media and emails.


DATA MODEL - A model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another.

DATA ELEMENT - Pieces of information. 

SOURCE OF STRUCTURED DATA 
	- Spreadsheets and data bases


#### DATA MODELING LEVELS AND TECHNIQUES

**Data modeling** is the process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized and structured.

COMMON TYPES OF DATA MODELING
	- CONCEPTUAL  - gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization. For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details.
	-
	- LOGICAL  -focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.
	-
	- PHYSICAL -depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.

DATA MODELING TECHNIQUES

ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM - A visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data mode. 

UNIFIED MODELING LANGUAGE (UML) - Are very detailed diagram that describe the structure of a system.



#### KNOW THE DATA YOU ARE WORKING WITH 

DATA TYPE - A specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value the data is.
	- lets u know what data type you are working with.

DATA TYPES IN SPREADSHEETS

-NUMBER
-TEXT OR STRING 
-BOOLEAN

BOOLEAN LOGIC

- and, or, and not operator.
	-Example of multiple conditions >> “IF ((Color = “Grey”) OR (Color = “Pink”)) AND (Waterproof=“True”).


ROWS are called records
COLUMNS are fields



WIDE DATA - Data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple column to hold the values or various attributes of the subject.
	- it is preferred when: Creating tables and charts with a few variables about each subject
	- Comparing straightforward line graphs

LONG DATA - Data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows. 
	-  is a great format for storing and organizing data when there's multiple 
	- it is preferred when: Storing a lot of variables about each subject. For example, 60 years worth of interest rates for each bank
	- Performing advanced statistical analysis or graphing

variables for each subject at each time point that we want to observe.

DATA TRANSFORMATION- is the process of changing the data's format, structure, or values.



#### UNBIASED AND OBJECTIVE DATA


BIAS a preference in favor of or against a person

DATA BIAS is a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction

SAMPLING BIAS when a sample isnt representative of the population as a whole.

	if you dont use random sampling you may end up favoring one putcome.

UNBIASED SAMPLINE when a sample is represenative of the population being measured.

OBSERVER BIAS (experimenter or research bias) - the tendency for different people to observe things differently.

INTERPRETATION BIAS - The tendency to always interpret ambihuous situations in a positive or negative way.

CONFIRMATION BIAS - The tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs.


##### IDENTIFYING GOOD DATA SOURCES

Reliable
Original
Comprehensive 
Current
Cited

#### DATA ETHICS AND PRIVACY

DATA ETHICS well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate now data is collected, shared, and used.

GDPR - general data protection regulation of the european union

**ASPECTS OF DATA ETHICS**

ownership - individuals own the raw data they provide and have primary contri=ol of its usage

transaction transparency - all data -processing and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by the individual who provides their data.


consent

currency  - Individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions. If your data is helping to fund a company's efforts, you should know what those efforts are all about and be given the opportunity to opt out.

-----

DATA PRIVACY  preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs.

**Data anonymization** - is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating that kind of information. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.

**de-identification**, which is **a process used to wipe data clean of all personally identifying information**.
