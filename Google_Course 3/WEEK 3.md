RELATIONAL DATABASE - A database that contains series of related tables that can be connected via their relationships.

### Database Normalization

**Normalization** is a process of organizing data in a relational database.

Some tables don't require a primary key. For example, a revenue table can have multiple foreign keys and not have a primary key. A primary key may also be constructed using multiple columns of a table. This type of primary key is called a **composite key**.
