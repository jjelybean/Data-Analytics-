### COMMUNICATION IS KEY

**LIMITATIONS OF DATA**

**the case of incomplete or nonexistent dat**a

	If you have incomplete or nonexistent data, you might realize during an analysis that you don't have enough data to reach a conclusion. Or, you might even be solving a different problem altogether!

**dont miss misaligned data**

		If you're collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules. So one team might define and measure things in a completely different way than another.

**clean dirty data**

		Dirty data refers to data that contains errors.

In any organization, a big part of a data analyst’s role is making sound judgments. When you know the limitations of your data, you can make judgment calls that help people make better decisions supported by the data. Data is an extremely powerful tool for decision-making, but if it is incomplete, misaligned, or hasn’t been cleaned, then it can be misleading. Take the necessary steps to make sure that your data is complete and consistent. Clean the data before you begin your analysis to save yourself and possibly others a great amount of time and effort.


Below are some of the best practices he recommends for good data storytelling: 

-   **Compare the same types of data**: Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization. Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics. 
    
-   **Visualize with care**: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.
    
-   **Leave out needless graphs:** If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.
    
-   **Test for statistical significance:** Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.
    
-   **Pay attention to sample size**: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods.
