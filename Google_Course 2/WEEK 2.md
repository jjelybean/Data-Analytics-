### UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF DATA 

**DATA DRIVEN & DATA INSPIRED DECISION MAKING** 

**DATA-INSPIRED DECISION-MAKING**
		- Explores different data sources to find out what they have in common.
		
**ALGORITHM** - A process or set of rules to be followed for a spsecific task. 

*most of the data is meaninigless until someone adds interpretation*
	- context is important.
	- understanding and applying data. 

	As a quick reminder, the goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. That all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data.

	accurate interpretation of data is key to data-driven decisions.

	When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses.

	. It is important for you to keep a data-driven mindset, ask lots of questions, experiment with many different possibilities, and use both logic and creativity along the way.

	there is a difference between making a decision with incomplete data and making a decision with a small amount of data.

###### 2 KINDS OF DATA

**QUANTITATIVE DATA** 
		- Specific and objective measures of numerical facts.
		- what, how many , how often; things you can measure

**QUALITATIVE DATA** 
		- Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics.
		- cant be measured numerically;
		- numbers visualized -- (why numbers are the way they are.)

###### QUALITATIVE DATA TOOLS 

- Focus groups
- Social media text analysis
- In-person interviews 

###### QUANTITTATIVE DATA TOOLS 

- Structured interviews 
- Surveys 
- Polls 

In other words, quantitative data generally gives you the what, and qualitative data generally gives you the why


### FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE

**REPORT** - static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically

- High level historical data
- easy to design
- pre-cleaned and sorted data

		- Continual maintenance
		- less visually appealing 
		- static

**DASHBOARD** - Monitors live, incoming data.

- Dynamic
- automatic
- interactive
- more stakeholder access 

		- Labor-intensive design
		- can be confusing 
		- potentially unclean data.

**PIVOT TABLE** - A data summarization tool that is used in data processing.
	- Used to summarize, sort, reorganize, group, total or average data stored in a database. 



### DATA vs METRICS

- Data starts as a collection of raw facts, until we organize them into individual metrics that represent a single type of data.

**METRICS** - Single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. 

	Metrics can also be combined into formulas that you can plug your numerical data into;
	Usually involves simple math



### DESIGNING COMPELLING DASHBOARDS

###### Creating a dashboard

- Identify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it
		- To get started with thisyou need to ask effective questions 
				- https://s3.amazonaws.com/looker-elearning-resources/Requirements+Gathering+Worksheet.pdf
- Design the dashboard (what should be displayed)
- Create mock-ups if desired
- Select the visualizations you will use on the dashboard
			- . If your goal is to show how each part contributes to the whole amount being reported, a pie or donut chart is probably a better choice.
			- If you need to show a change of values over time, line charts or bar graphs might be the best choice
- Create filters as needed
		- Filters show certain data while hiding the rest of the data in a dashboard.
		- can be a big help to identify patterns while keeping the original data intact.


###### TYPES OF DASHBOARDS

-   **Strategic**: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics
		- These dashboards provide information over the longest time frame—from a single financial quarter to years.
    
-   **Operational:** short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals.
		- most common type of dashboard.
		- these dashboards contain information on a time scale of days, weeks, or months, they can provide performance insight almost in real-time.

-   **Analytical:** consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets
		- contain a vast amount of data used by data analyst.
		- these dashboards contain the details involved in the usage, analysis, and predictions made by data scientists.


### CONNECTING THE DATA DOTS

**MATHEMATICAL THINKING** 
	- is a powerful skill you can use to help you solve problems and see new solutions.
	- It means looking at a problem and logically breaking it down step-by-step, so you can see the relationship of patterns in your data, and use that to analyze your problem. 
	- This kind of thinking can also help you figure out the best tools for analysis 


###### The three (or four) V words for big data

When thinking about the benefits and challenges of big data, it helps to think about the three Vs: volume, variety, and velocity. 

**Volume** describes the amount of data.
**Variety** describes the different kinds of data. **Velocity** describes how fast the data can be processed. 
**Veracity** refers to the quality and reliability of the data.
