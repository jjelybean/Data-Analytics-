### PROBLEM-SOLVING AND EFFECTIVE QUESTIONING 

*We're going to talk about the difference between effective and ineffective questions and learn how to ask great questions that lead to insights that can help you solve business problems. You will discover that effective questions help you to make the most of all the data analysis phases.*

- In the ask step, we define the problem we're solving and make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. This will help keep you focused on the actual problem, which leads to more successful outcomes.

**STRUCTURED THINKING** - The process of recognizing the current problem or situatuon, organizing available information, revealing gaps and oppurtunities, and identifying options.

### TAKE ACTION WITH DATA

- Knowing your **TARGET AUDIENCE** refer to the people you are trying to reach.

- Collaborating with stakeholders and understanding their needs,  is another important step in problem solving.

**MARKETING ANALYSIS** - Is the process of measuring, analyzing, and managing a company's marketing strategy and budget. 

###### Step 1: Ask

It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

-   Define the problem you’re trying to solve
    
-   Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
    
-   Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
    
-   Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
    
-   Take a step back and see the whole situation in context
    

###### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1.  What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
    
2.  Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?


### SOLVE PROBLEMS WITH DATA

##### 6 TYPES OF PROBLEMS

- **MAKING PREDICTIONS** 
		- Using data to make an informed decision avbout how things may be in the future.
	
- **CATEGORIZING THINGS**
		- assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features.
	
- **SPOTTING SOMETHING UNUSUAL** 
		-  Identifying data that is different than the norm.
		
- **IDENTIFYING THEMES** 
		- Grouping categorized information into broader concepts.
		- **Themes** are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data.
		- In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.
		
- **DISCOVERING CONNECTIONS**
		- Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them
		
- **FINDING PATTERNS**
		- Using historical data to understand what happened in the pst and is therefore likely to happen again. 


### CRAFT EFFECTIVE QUESTIONS 

Effective questions follow the SMART methodology

**SPECIFIC** are simple, significantm focused on one topic or a few closely related ideas. 
**MEASURABLE** can be quantified or assessed.
**ACTION-ORIENTED** encouurage change
**RELEVANT** questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you are trying to solve. 
**TIME-BOUND** specify the time to be studied.

No matter how much information you have or how advanced your tools are, your data won’t tell you much if you don’t start with the right questions. 

Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: **What features do people look for when buying a new car?**

-   **Specific**: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?
    
-   **Measurable**: Does the question include a feature rating system?
    
-   **Action-oriented**: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?
    
-   **Relevant**: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?
    
-   **Time-bound**: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years?


*Questions should be open ended*

###### Things to avoid when asking questions

**Leading questions**: questions that only have a particular response
**Closed-ended questions**: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only
**Vague questions:** questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context
